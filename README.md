Tales
=====

These are some tales I've written (and am still writing!) using LaTeX. They're
not much useful unless you understand Italian and are willing to read what I
think about certain situations and people.

How to compile
--------------

To read them you must install **pdflatex**. Once you got it, type the following
commands in a shell:

    $ cd ultimo-guerriero
    $ pdflatex ultimo-guerriero.tex

This will, for example, compile my tale "L'ultimo guerriero". The same goes for
the others.

License
-------

The tales are free to read, but you cannot modify them nor claim they're yours!
