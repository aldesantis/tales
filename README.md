# Tales

This is a collection of short stories and papers I have written with LaTeX.

## Compiling

To compile a file and turn it into a readable PDF you will need `pdflatex` and
[memoir](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/memoir).

After you have installed all the dependencies, compile a tale by navigating to its directory and
running:

```console
$ pdflatex file-name.tex
$ pdflatex file-name.tex
```

The command must be run twice.
