Tales
=====
This is a collection of short stories I have written using LaTeX.

Compiling
---------
To compile a file and turn it into a readable PDF you will need the ```pdflatex``` binary along with some TeX Live
packages (like the famous [memoir](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/memoir)).

After you have installed all the dependencies, compile a tale by navigating to its directory and running:

```console
$ pdflatex file-name.tex
$ pdflatex file-name.tex
```

The command must be run twice to generate the ToC (Table of Contents).
